# matgpt

This project integrates OpenAI's ChatGPT API with MATLAB, enabling users to interact with the GPT-4 model directly from the MATLAB IDE. By leveraging MATLAB's HTTP communication capabilities, the project provides a seamless way to send prompts to the ChatGPT model and retrieve AI-generated responses in real-time. This integration can be used for automated MATLAB scripting, data analysis, or educational purposes, allowing for dynamic interaction with an AI model within the MATLAB environment.

# Features
* HTTP Communication: Utilizes MATLAB's webwrite function to send POST requests to the OpenAI API.
* Customizable API Calls: Easily modify the prompts and other parameters to tailor the interaction with ChatGPT.
* Response Handling: Parses and displays the response from ChatGPT directly in the MATLAB console.

# Prerequisites
* MATLAB: Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.
* OpenAI API Key: Obtain an API key from OpenAI.

# File Structure
* chatgpt.m: The main function that makes HTTP calls to the OpenAI API.
* run_chatgpt.m: A script that demonstrates how to use the chatgpt.m function with a sample prompt.
README.md: This document.

# Setup and Installation
1.) Clone the Repository
--
git clone git@github.com:your-username/MATLAB-ChatGPT-Integration.git
cd MATLAB-ChatGPT-Integration
--
2.) Add Your OpenAI API Key:
--
Open run_chatgpt.m.
Replace 'your-api-key' with your actual OpenAI API key.
--
3.) Run the Example:
In MATLAB, navigate to the project directory and run:
--
run_chatgpt
--

# Usage of "chatgpt.m"
This function sends a prompt to the OpenAI ChatGPT API and returns the model's response.

# Usage of run_chatgpt.m"
This script demonstrates how to use the chatgpt.m function with a sample prompt.
